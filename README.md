# PHP-File-Downloader
 Simple PHP program to download any file from URL to your server

The way it works is very simple, first you need to specify a file url which you want to download, and second specify a folder/directory where you want the downloaded file to be there (leave it empty if you want to download the file on the root directory). Then click the download button. Done!
